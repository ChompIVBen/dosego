          <h2>dosego.org's Mission</h2>
          <p class="muted small">dosego.org is a public health initiative that restores freedom of movement to people 
            receiving methadone treatment, recognizing mobility, autonomy, and social connection as essential
             determinants of health. Many individuals decline or disengage from methadone care due to the rigid, 
             daily clinic requirements often described as “liquid handcuffs,” which prevent participation in weddings,
              funerals, family milestones, work opportunities, and travel. Grounded in harm-reduction principles and 
              informed by research such as the Rat Park study, dosego.org challenges the idea that recovery must come at 
              the cost of a meaningful life. Instead, it reframes methadone treatment as something that should support 
              stability, dignity, and connection. By simplifying travel coordination and reducing logistical and 
              administrative barriers, dosego.org addresses a systemic gap in treatment infrastructure—one that
               disproportionately affects low-income individuals and those with limited flexibility—so that
                continuity of care and freedom do not have to be mutually exclusive.
    
           <br> <br><strong>dosego.org's future goals:</strong>
            <p>
                dosego.org’s long-term goal is to modernize how methadone clinics and patients coordinate care by
                 strengthening clinic-patient communication, reducing paperwork errors, and increasing transparency
                  throughout the travel dosing process. While the current platform empowers patients to initiate
                   requests with confidence through an itinerary builder and clinic-ready communication scripts,
                    future iterations aim to integrate clinic workflows directly—providing real-time request tracking, 
                    approval status updates, dosing confirmations, and cost visibility in one accessible interface. 
                    By reducing administrative friction on both sides, dosego.org seeks to normalize mobility within
                     methadone care and encourage broader institutional recognition that patient freedom supports,
                      rather than undermines, recovery. Ultimately, dosego.org envisions a treatment landscape where 
                      geographic freedom is not treated as an exception, but as a standard component of compassionate,
                       effective, and equitable public health practice.
